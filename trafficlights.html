        <h2>Permissive Traffic Light RL agent</h2>
        <p>
        Reinforcement Learning Project aiming to explore the viability of different RL concepts in a complex single-intersection traffic simulation.

        Primary Features include:
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Complex intersection dynamics. </b>Models realistic urban contraints including permissive yielding, shared, lanes, and multiple
                vehicle types. Agent learns a sophisticated policy that maximises traffic throughput.
            </li>
            <li><b>State-of-the-art Deep RL. </b> Employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for spatial state representation, utilising a Double DQN architecture. Value
                Decomposition helps solve credit assignment, as well as combinatorically expanding the action space such that every combination of
                safe traffic light phases can be chosen by the agent.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>High-fidelity simulation. </b>Utilises SUMO (Microsimulator) to provide an efficient environment that encapsulates granular
                vehicle movements, and allowing realistic traffic light phase transitions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
